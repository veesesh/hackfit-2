# How to start
To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal:
### npx create-react-app calendar-example
Now, add the React-Calendar library to our project using npm:

### npm install react-calendar

After this you can fork the project and can copy the code in ## App.js file from the project

Now go the calendar-example directory in you local system and delete the code in ##App.js file and paste the code which you copied
